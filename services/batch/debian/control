Description: Router Manager Batch Service
 A batch service that periodically resolves domain names and updates
 nftables rules for domain-based packet filtering on routers.
 .
 This service works in conjunction with dnsmasq and nftables to provide
 domain blocking functionality by resolving blocked domains to IP addresses
 and applying firewall rules accordingly.
